\title{Item Count Technique}
\usage{
ict.test(y, treat, J = NA, alpha = 0.05, n.draws = 250000, gms = TRUE,
  pi.table = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A numerical vector containing the response data for a list
experiment.}

\item{treat}{A numerical vector containing the binary treatment status for a
list experiment.}

\item{J}{Number of non-sensitive (control) survey items.}

\item{alpha}{Confidence level for the statistical test.}

\item{n.draws}{Number of Monte Carlo draws.}

\item{gms}{A logical value indicating whether the generalized moment
selection procedure should be used.}

\item{pi.table}{A logical value indicating whether a table of estimated
proportions of respondent types with standard errors is displayed.}
}
\value{
\code{ict.test} returns a numerical scalar with the
Bonferroni-corrected minimum p-value of the statistical test.
}
\description{
Function to conduct a statistical test with the null hypothesis that there
is no "design effect" in a list experiment, a failure of the experiment.
}
\details{
This function allows the user to perform a statistical test on data from a
list experiment or item count technique with the null hypothesis of no
design effect. A design effect occurs when an individual's response to the
non-sensitive items changes depending upon the respondent's treatment
status.
