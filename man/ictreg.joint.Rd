\usage{
ictreg.joint(formula, data = parent.frame(), treat = "treat", J,
  outcome = "outcome", outcome.reg = "logistic", constrained = FALSE,
  maxIter = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{An object of class "formula": a symbolic description of the
model to be fitted.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables in the model}

\item{treat}{Name of treatment indicator as a string. For single sensitive
item models, this refers to a binary indicator, and for multiple sensitive
item models it refers to a multi-valued variable with zero representing the
control condition. This can be an integer (with 0 for the control group) or
a factor (with "control" for the control group).}

\item{J}{Number of non-sensitive (control) survey items.}

\item{outcome}{Name of outcome indicator as a string.}

\item{outcome.reg}{Model for outcome regression. Options are "logistic" or
"linear;" default is "logistic".}

\item{constrained}{A logical value indicating whether the control group
parameters are constrained to be equal. Default is FALSE.}

\item{maxIter}{Maximum number of iterations for the Expectation-Maximization
algorithm of the ML estimation.  The default is 1000.}
}
\value{
\code{ictreg.joint} returns an object of class "ictreg.joint". The
function \code{summary} is used to obtain a table of the results. The object
\code{ictreg.joint} is a list that contains the following components.
\item{par.treat}{point estimate for effect of covariate on item count fitted
on treatment group} \item{se.treat}{standard error for estimate of effect of
covariate on item count fitted on treatment group} \item{par.control}{point
estimate for effect of covariate on item count fitted on control group}
\item{se.control}{standard error for estimate of effect of covariate on item
count fitted on control group} \item{par.outcome}{point estimate for effect
of covariate and sensitive item on outcome} \item{se.outcome}{standard error
for estimate of effect of covariate and sensitive item on outcome}
\item{coef.names}{variable names as defined in the data frame}
\item{constrained}{call indicating whether the constrained model is used}
\item{call}{the matched call} \item{data}{the \code{data} argument}
\item{outcome.reg}{the \code{outcome.reg} argument} \item{x}{the design
matrix} \item{y}{the response vector} \item{treat}{the vector indicating
treatment status} \item{J}{Number of non-sensitive (control) survey items
set by the user or detected.} \item{treat.labels}{a vector of the names used
by the \code{treat} vector for the sensitive item or items. This is the
names from the \code{treat} indicator if it is a factor, or the number of
the item if it is numeric.} \item{control.label}{a vector of the names used
by the \code{treat} vector for the control items. This is the names from the
\code{treat} indicator if it is a factor, or the number of the item if it is
numeric.}

\description{
Function to conduct multivariate regression analyses of survey data with the
item count technique, also known as the list experiment, using predicted
responses from list experiments as predictors in outcome regression models.
}
\details{
This function allows the user to perform regression analysis on survey data
with the item count technique, also known as the list experiment, using
predicted responses from list experiments as predictors in outcome
regression models.
