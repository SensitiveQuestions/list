model to be fitted.}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables in the model}

\item{treat}{Name of treatment indicator as a string. For single sensitive
item models, this refers to a binary indicator, and for multiple sensitive
item models it refers to a multi-valued variable with zero representing the
control condition. This can be an integer (with 0 for the control group) or
a factor (with "control" for the control group).}

\item{J}{Number of non-sensitive (control) survey items.}

\item{method}{Method for regression, either \code{ml} for the Maximum
Likelihood (ML) estimation with the Expectation-Maximization algorithm;
\code{lm} for linear model estimation; or \code{nls} for the Non-linear
Least Squares (NLS) estimation with the two-step procedure.}

\item{weights}{Name of the weights variable as a string, if weighted
regression is desired. Not implemented for the ceiling/floor models,
multiple sensitive item design, or for the modified design.}

\item{h}{Auxiliary data functionality. Optional named numeric vector with
length equal to number of groups. Names correspond to group labels and
values correspond to auxiliary moments.}

\item{group}{Auxiliary data functionality. Optional character vector of
group labels with length equal to number of observations.}

\item{matrixMethod}{Auxiliary data functionality. Procedure for estimating
optimal weighting matrix for generalized method of moments. One of
"efficient" for two-step feasible and "cue" for continuously updating.
Default is "efficient". Only relevant if \code{h} and \code{group} are
specified.}

\item{overdispersed}{Indicator for the presence of overdispersion. If
\code{TRUE}, the beta-binomial model is used in the EM algorithm, if
\code{FALSE} the binomial model is used. Not relevant for the \code{NLS} or
\code{lm} methods.}

\item{constrained}{A logical value indicating whether the control group
parameters are constrained to be equal.  Not relevant for the \code{NLS} or

be used to adjust for the possible presence of respondents dishonestly
reporting a negative preference for the sensitive item among those who hold
negative views of all the non-sensitive items.}

should be used to adjust for the possible presence of respondents
dishonestly reporting a negative preference for the sensitive item among
those who hold affirmative views of all the non-sensitive items.}

the floor liar model. \code{glm} uses standard logistic regression, while
\code{bayesglm} uses logistic regression with a weakly informative prior

be a subset of the covariates used in \code{formula}.}

\item{fit.start}{Fit method for starting values for standard design

which use OLS, logistic regression, and non-linear least squares to generate
starting values, respectively. The default is \code{nls}.}

\code{nls} method and the starting values for the \code{ml} method for the
\code{modified} design. Options are \code{glm} and \code{nls}, and the
default is \code{nls}.}

\item{multi.condition}{For the multiple sensitive item design, covariates
representing the estimated count of affirmative responses for each
respondent can be included directly as a level variable by choosing
\code{level}, or as indicator variables for each value but one by choosing
\code{indicators}. The default is \code{none}.}

\description{
Function to conduct multivariate regression analyses of survey data with the
item count technique, also known as the list experiment and the unmatched
count technique.
}
\details{
This function allows the user to perform regression analysis on data from
the item count technique, also known as the list experiment and the
unmatched count technique.

Three list experiment designs are accepted by this function: the standard
design; the multiple sensitive item standard design; and the modified design
proposed by Corstange (2009).

For the standard design, three methods are implemented in this function: the
linear model; the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation for the
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm; the nonlinear least squares (NLS)
estimation with the two-step procedure both proposed in Imai (2010); and the
Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator in the presence of two types of dishonest
responses, "ceiling" and "floor" liars. The ceiling model, floor model, or
both, as described in Blair and Imai (2010) can be activated by using the
\code{ceiling} and \code{floor} options. The constrained and unconstrained
ML models presented in Imai (2010) are available through the
\code{constrained} option, and the user can specify if overdispersion is
present in the data for the no liars models using the \code{overdispersed}
option to control whether a beta-binomial or binomial model is used in the
EM algorithm to model the item counts.

The modified design and the multiple sensitive item design are automatically
detected by the function, and only the binomial model without overdispersion
is available.
