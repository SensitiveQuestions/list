\usage{
\method{summary}{ictreg}(object, boundary.proportions = FALSE,
  n.draws = 10000, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object of class inheriting from "ictreg"}

\item{boundary.proportions}{A switch indicating whether, for models with
ceiling effects, floor effects, or both (indicated by the \code{floor =
TRUE}, \code{ceiling = TRUE} options in ictreg), the conditional probability
of lying and the population proportions of liars are calculated.}

\item{n.draws}{For quasi-Bayesian approximation based predictions, specify
the number of Monte Carlo draws.}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to or from other methods.}
}
\description{
Function to summarize results from list experiment regression based on the
ictreg() function, and to produce proportions of liars estimates.
}
\details{
\code{predict.ictreg} produces a summary of the results from an
\code{ictreg} object. It displays the coefficients, standard errors, and fit
statistics for any model from \code{ictreg}.

\code{predict.ictreg} also produces estimates of the conditional probability
of lying and of the population proportion of liars for boundary models from
\code{ictreg()} if \code{ceiling = TRUE} or \code{floor = TRUE}.

The conditional probability of lying for the ceiling model is the
probability that a respondent with true affirmative views of all the
sensitive and non-sensitive items lies and responds negatively to the
sensitive item. The conditional probability for the floor model is the
probability that a respondent lies to conceal her true affirmative views of
the sensitive item when she also holds true negative views of all the
non-sensitive items. In both cases, the respondent may believe her privacy
is not protected, so may conceal her true affirmative views of the sensitive
item.
