\description{
This dataset is a subset of the 1994 Multi-Investigator Survey and contains
the item count technique or the list experiment.  The main question reads as
follows: \verb{ Now I'm going to read you four things that sometimes make
people angry or upset.  After I read all (three/four), just tell me HOW MANY
of them upset you.  (I don't want to know which ones, just how many.)  (1)
"the federal government increasing the tax on gasoline;" (2) "professional
athletes getting million-dollar-plus salaries;" (3) "requiring seatbelts be
used when driving;" (4) "large corporations polluting the environment;" (5)
"black leaders asking the government for affirmative action."}
}
\details{
where the last item is presented only with the treatment group and the
control list only contains the first three items.

The survey also includes a question in which attitudes toward the sensitive
item are asked directly.

\verb{ Now I'm going to ask you about another thing that sometimes makes
people angry or upset. Do you get angry or upset when black leaders ask the
government for affirmative action?}
