\description{
This dataset is a subset of the 1991 National Race and Politics Survey and
contains the item count technique or the list experiment.  The main question
reads as follows: \verb{ Now I'm going to read you four things that
sometimes make people angry or upset.  After I read all (three/four), just
tell me HOW MANY of them upset you.  (I don't want to know which ones, just
how many.)  (1) "the federal government increasing the tax on gasoline;" (2)
"professional athletes getting million-dollar-plus salaries;" (3) "large
corporations polluting the environment;" (4) "black leaders asking the
government for affirmative action."}
