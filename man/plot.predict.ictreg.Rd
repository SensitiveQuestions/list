\title{Plot Method for the Item Count Technique} 
\description{ 
Function to plot predictions and confidence intervals of predictions from estimates from multivariate regression analysis of survey data with the item count technique.
} 
\usage{

  \method{plot}{predict.ictreg}(x, labels = NA, axes.ict = TRUE,
                                xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL, xlab = NULL, 
				ylab = "Estimated Proportion",
                                axes = F, pch = 19, xvec = NULL, ...) 

} 

\arguments{ 
\item{x}{object or set of objects of class inheriting from "predict.ictreg". Either a single object from an \code{ictreg()} model fit or multiple \code{predict} objects combined with the c() function. }
\item{labels}{a vector of labels for each prediction, plotted at the x axis.}
\item{axes.ict}{a switch indicating if custom plot axes are to be used with the user-provided estimate \code{labels}.}
\item{xlim}{a title for the y axis.}
\item{ylim}{a title for the y axis.}
\item{xlab}{a title for the x axis.}
\item{ylab}{a title for the y axis.}
\item{axes}{an indicator for whether default plot axes are included.}
\item{pch}{either an integer specifying a symbol or a single character to be used as the default in plotting points.}
\item{xvec}{a vector of x values at which the proportions will be printed.}
\item{...}{Other graphical parameters to be passed to the \code{plot()} command are accepted.}
}

\details{\code{plot.predict.ictreg} produces plots with estimated population proportions of respondents answering the sensitive item in a list experiment in the affirmative, with confidence intervals. 

The function accepts a set of \code{predict.ictreg} objects calculated in the following manner:

\code{predict(ictreg.object, avg = TRUE, interval = "confidence")}

For each average prediction, a point estimate and its confidence interval is plotted at equally spaced intervals. The x location of the points can be manipulated with the \code{xvec} option.

Either a single predict object can be plotted, or a group of them combined with \code{c(predict.object1, predict.object2)}. Predict objects with the \code{newdata.diff} option, which calculates the mean difference in probability between two datasets, and the \code{direct.glm} option, which calculates the mean difference between the mean predicted support for the sensitive item in the list experiment and in a direct survey item, can also be plotted in the same way as other \code{predict} objects.
