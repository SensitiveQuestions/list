\arguments{
\item{object}{Object of class inheriting from "ictreg.joint"}

\item{newdata}{An optional data frame containing data that will be used to
make predictions from. If omitted, the data used to fit the regression are
used.}

predictions from the data in the provided newdata data frame.}

\item{se.fit}{A switch indicating if standard errors are required.}

\item{level}{Significance level for confidence intervals.}

\item{avg}{A switch indicating if the mean prediction and associated
statistics across all obserations in the dataframe will be returned instead
of predictions for each observation.}

\item{sensitive.value}{User-specified value for the sensitive item.}

\item{sensitive.diff}{A switch indicating if the difference in predictions
when the sensitive item = 1 and when the sensitive item = 0 is calculated.}

}
\value{
\code{predict.ictreg.joint} produces a vector of predictions or a
matrix of predictions and bounds with column names fit, lwr, and upr if
interval is set. If sensitive.value = "both", \code{predict.ictreg.joint}
will produce a list, where the first element corresponds to when the
sensitive item = 0 and the second element corresponds to when the sensitive
item = 1. If sensitive.diff = TRUE, the third element in the list
corresponds to the difference (sensitive = 0 subtracted from sensitive = 1).
If se.fit is TRUE, a list with the following components is returned:

\item{fit}{vector or matrix as above.} \item{se.fit}{standard error of
prediction(s)}

If return.draws is TRUE, the list includes

\item{draws.predict}{A matrix of draws from a multivariate normal
distribution with mean equal to the vector of estimated coefficients from
the outcome regression model, and sigma equal to the variance-covariance
matrix of the outcome regression model. Rows are observations; colums are
10,000 draws. If sensitive.value = both, will be a list of two elements
where each element is a matrix as described; the first matrix will be for
when the sensitive item = 0, the second matrix will be for when the
sensitive item = 1. If newdata.diff is provided, \code{draws.predict} will
be a list of two elements where each element is a matrix as described; the
first matrix will correspond to the newdata data frame; the second matrix
will correspond to the newdata.diff data frame.} \item{draws.mean}{The
\code{draws.predict} matrix averaged over all observations; a vector of
10,000 draws. If sensitive.value = both, will be a list of two elements
where each element is a vector as described; the first matrix will be for
when the sensitive item = 0, the second matrix will be for when the
sensitive item = 1. If newdata.diff is provided, \code{draws.mean} will be a
list of two elements where each element is a matrix as described; the first
matrix will correspond to the newdata data frame; the second matrix will
correspond to the newdata.diff data frame.} \item{sens.diff}{If
sensitive.diff = TRUE, a vector of 10,000 draws generated from subtracting
the first item in \code{draws.mean} from the second item. A vector of 10,000
draws.}

If predict.sensitive = TRUE, the list also includes

\item{fitsens}{a vector of predictions and bounds with column names fit,
lwr, and upr if interval is set, generated from the sensitive item model.}
\item{draws.predict.sens}{A matrix of draws from a multivariate normal
distribution with mean equal to the vector of estimated coefficients from
the sensitive item model, and sigma equal to the variance-covariance matrix
of the sensitive item model. Rows are observations; colums are 10,000 draws
(only returned if return.draws is TRUE). If newdata.diff is provided, this
will be a list of two matrices as described. The first will correspond to
newdata, and the second to newdata.diff.} \item{draws.mean.sens}{The
\code{draws.predict.sens} matrix averaged over all observations; a vector of
10,000 draws (only returned if return.draws is TRUE). If newdata.diff is
provided, this will be a list of two matrices as described. The first will
correspond to newdata, and the second to newdata.diff.}

\description{
Function to calculate predictions and uncertainties of predictions from
estimates from multivariate regression analysis of survey data with the item
count technique, using predicted responses to list experiments as predictors
in outcome regressions.
}
\details{
\code{predict.ictreg.joint} produces predicted values, obtained by
evaluating the regression function in the frame newdata (which defaults to
model.frame(object)). By using sensitive.value, users must set the value of
z -- the latent response to the sensitive item -- to be either zero or one,
depending on the prediction that the user requires.

Two additional types of mean prediction are also available. The first, if a
newdata.diff data frame is provided by the user, calculates the mean
predicted values across two datasets, as well as the mean difference in
predicted value. Standard errors and confidence intervals are also added.
For newdata.diff predictions, sensitive.value must be set to 1 or 0, not
"both" (and sensitive.diff must also be set to FALSE).  Users may also set
the logical sensitive.diff to TRUE and sensitive.value to "both", which will
output the mean predicted values across all observations for z = 0 as well
as z = 1, in addition to the mean difference in predicted value. Standard
errors and confidence intervals are also added. For difference predictions
(sensitive.diff and newdata.diff), the option avg must be set to TRUE.

Users can also use the predict.sensitive = TRUE option to generate
predictions of responses to the sensitive item, with standard errors and
confidence intervals.

NOTE: In order to generate predictions from user-provided data frames
(newdata and newdata.diff), users MUST run models using \code{ictreg.joint}
on data that does not contain any missingness.  Further, the data frames
provided to \code{predict.ictreg.joint} must also not contain any
missingness.
